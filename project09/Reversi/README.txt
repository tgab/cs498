Ravenous Reversi README

1. Compile and run the Reversi directory from the Virtual Machine Emulator

2. Welcome screen gives two options:
	- select 1 to play a game against the computer (this is the default option)
	- select 2 to play a game with two people

3. The rules for playing Reversi can be found at http://www.vieka.com/reversi/othello.htm
   These rules have been strictly followed in our implementation.  In the case that one player does not have any valid moves left play switches to the other player.  If both players have no remaining valid moves, then the game is over.  The player with the greatest number of discs on the board wins.
