Hey, these are just some ideas, feel free to ask questions and change or add things

We should have 3 classes

Main.jack -  create and run the game
Board.jack - construct and manage the game board
Game.jack - manage the game's logic and scoring



Main.jack
----------
Initialize a new game instance and run it(Very similar to Sample Square Main.Jack)

Board.jack  //Game board
-----------
-We should have a constructor that creates a new board (initializes the board)
-Destructor to deallocate memory, etc
-Method that gets the current X and Y position assuming we use a grid System
-Method to Draw the board
-Method to set piece
-Method to get Color of piece
-Method to Draw the game piece (circle - white or black...color can be boolean(black/white)
-Method to Draw the game piece on the Board at X Y location
-Method to indicate where we are on the board.. cursor of some sort?
-Method to move that cursor to wherever we are currently to indicate current location

Game.jack
----------
-Constructor to create a new game(Initialize the game, board and score)
-Destructor 
-Method to handle a player's turn
-----move the cursor in regards to arrow keys
-----Make a "move"
-Method to iterate turns between players until end of game
-Method to indicate which player's turn it is
-Method to make a move(make the move and determine whether it's legal)
-Method to Check Victory (Refer to Game Rules)
-Method to update Scores
